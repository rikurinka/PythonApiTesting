install node.js
convert report to html format
install allure command line tool

npm install -g allure-commandline --save-dev

#Git - source course management software

1.Track changes in File
2.Manage source
3.version and branching(new not complete access of code)
4.compare code
5.merge branch
6.compare branches etc

#Gitub - webbased repository centralised

A
whatever code in local repo (commit) - transfer to remote repo(push code)

B
new - use code - local repo - clone the code for first time
done changes - put code in local repo(commit) - push the code to remote repo

A-pull - changes - use it

GitHub - remote repo

Step:
Login to Github with account
create new repository and rename it as any name (here for eg: Automation001)

Open google.com and download git bash
install the software
after installation - open gitbash
type git --version

Global commands

Set UserName
Set Password

open gitbash and type below commands

git config --global user.name "rikurinka"

to check username is configured correctly
git config user.name

git config --global user.email "rikurinkag@yahoo.in"

to check username email
git config user.email
to check all list
git config --list

By default gitbash will work in c drive to change the drive

cd D:

to create a new folder

mkdir <foldername> [for eg: mkdir CodeRepository]

to navigate into created folder

cd CodeRepository

to check are you in correct folder path type below command
pwd

to intialize type following command

git init

Goto Local folder coderepository folder - copy and paste any file

File will be in 3 states

untracked - git is not able to get the file

staged - share the command to team member - intermediate state
ready to track or untracked

tracked - tracked by git and share file to team member and push

pwd
type below command, it will show the newly added files in the folder
git status

git commit -m "This is automation started"

to check status
git status

if we move to untrack stage we need type below command
git reset HEAD <filename>
for eg:
git reset HEAD taskOne.py

to check status
git status

to commit:
git commit -m "This is a new <file>"

to check log:
git log

to check the changes done in the particular file type below command:
git diff <filename>
for eg:
git diff taskOne.py

it will what was earlier and what is latest change

to discard the changes type below command
git checkout -- <filename>
git checkout -- taskOne.py
git status (changes will be reverted in that file)

to check whether code is in remote repository
git remote -v

to make link with remoe repo, goto github and copy the link where new repo is created
for eg:
https://github.com/rikurinka/Automation001.git

to add into remote repo type below command
git remote add origin "https://github.com/rikurinka/Automation001.git"

to check in remote
git remote -v

to push the local folder repo code to remote repo type below command
git push origin master

to clone the repository as user B

open git bash
create a repository
for eg:
mkdir Repository2
cd Repository2
pwd

Goto github and click name of the repo and click code
copy clone link
goto gitbash

git clone "https://github.com/rikurinka/Automation001.git"

after completing type below command to check
